## Day 1
### Sample Population
- The use of a **~={blue}subset=~** of a population to <u>represent</u> the whole population. 
- ~={blue}Sampling plans=~ or ~={blue}experimental designs=~ are the ways observations are selected from a population to be used as samples

### Probabilistic/Random Sampling
#### Simple Random Sampling
- Every sample of size $n$ has the same chance of being selected.
- A sample following these indicators is called a **~={blue}simple random sample=~**

#### Stratified Random Sampling
- Consists of two or more subpopulations (**~={blue}strata=~**)
- Involves a <u>simple random sample</u> from each of a given number of subpopulations.
- Ensures that each subpopulation is represented in the sample is called a **~={blue}stratified random sample=~**

#### Cluster Sampling
- Selecting a <u>simple random sample</u> of clusters from the available clusters of a population.
- If a clusters is selected, then **all members of that cluster will be included** in the overall sample
- Some clusters will not have representation

#### 1-in-k Systematic Random Sample
- Involves the random selection of one of the first $k$ elements in an ordered population

### Non-Probabilistic Sampling 
- Cannot be used for making statistical inferences about the populations they came from.
- **Convenience Sampling:** subjects are selected because of their convenient accessibility or proximity to the researcher/s
- **Judgement Sampling:** allows the researcher to decide who will be included in the sample based on the researchers judgement
- **Quota Sampling:** the makeup of the sample must reflect the makeup of the population based on some preselected characteristic

### Observational Study
- Often administered through a survey.
- The data already existed before the researcher's decision to observe or describe it.

### Potential issues
- **Nonresponse:** Only a portion of the carefully selected random sample responded.
- **Under Coverage:** Sample systematically excludes certain segments.
- **Wording Bias:** Questionnaire may have questions that are too complicated or confusing for the reader. May also be too sensitive in topic.
