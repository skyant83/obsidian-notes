## Permutation 
(Distinct Objects)
- refers to an arrangement of these objects
- $P(n,r)$, $nPr$, $P_r^n$
- $P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$

(Repeating Objects)
- applies when all objects are not distinct
- $P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\cdots n_k!}$

(Circular Permutation)
- arrangement in a circular manner, the number of arrangements are less
- $P(n,r) = (n-1)!$

## Combination
- used when order or arrangement is not important
- $C(n,r)$, $nCr$, $C_r^n$, $\binom{n}{r}$
- $C(n,r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$
