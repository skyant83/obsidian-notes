## A Critical Realist Definition of Religion (Christian Smith)
#### What is Religion
- Less about what's in your head 
- More about what you do because of those beliefs
- Not about beliefs themselves, but the practices behind them
- A framework for addressing needs (essential aspect in the human experience)

####  Rituals, ceremonies, prayers
- About connecting with something bigger than yourself (superhuman powers ⟶ capacities beyond human reach)
- To receive goods or avoid bads
- More action than just thought
- Certain actions can influence certain outcomes (possibly beyond our control)
	- Actively participating in the process
- Has real word effect ⟶ force shaping lives, societies, big cultural movements

## The Problem of Evil (Nagasawa & Ricoeur)
#### Nagasawa
- The potential limitations of an all powerful God
- Some argue that evil is necessary for a greater good
- If God prevents all suffering ⟶ it would remove freewill (agency)

#### Ricoeur
- Evil ≠ proof that God doesnt exists
- Doesn't explain evil away ⟶ focuses instead on responding to it
	- acknowledging the suffering and facing it
- Evil ⟶ Challenge (forces to re-examine belief and dig deeper) (individually and communally)

## Religious Faith and the experience of trust (Marcel)
#### Faith as a Leap
- A lived experience
- less about blind trust
- more about deep trust beyond proof
	- deep expectation of goodness
	- even if not right now
	- takes a lot of surrender
- Can change things
	- can inspire people to live up to that trust
	- its not passive (trust = active force)
- What we believe changes how we see the world
- Trust is the key ingredient in faith and religion

#### Faith as Love
- To love someone is to expect something from someone
- Something that can't be easily defined or predict
- Empowers them to live up to that expectation

#### Faith in religion
- Isn't passive
- Actively engaging with something bigger than yourself
- Choosing to trust even with doubts
- Its not about knowing, its about hoping

## "I hope in you" to "I hope in Thee for us" (Marcel)
#### "I hope in you" ⟶ personal
#### "I hope in Thee for us" ⟶ communal
- sharing a commitment to something bigger than self-interests
- shared good
- taking action together

## Secularism (Charles Taylor)
- Not just atheism
- Loss in trust
	- Stopped believing that those superhuman powers can still help us
	- Where there used to be
		- Rules⟶ Cosmic Justice
		- Actions with consequences
- Less supernatural
- More physical
- More emphasis on individual freedom
	- Harder to get that "I hope in Thee for us"
	- Self-interest ≠ Group-interests
- Rituals could build back that trust
	- Being a part of something bigger
	- New rituals that make sense in modern times
