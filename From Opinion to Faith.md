- The antithesis of belief is not doubt, but opinion

### Conviction

> "*Someone may inquire whether it would not be appropriate to intercalate between opinion and faith an intermediate link, namely conviction.*" (130)
> 
> "*Conviction here refers to a limit, an end, a bar that has been drawn. My investigations can reveal nothing more. This mean: the cause is known to me; it is useless to talk about it further. Thus conviction in principle refers to the past; if it does refer to the future, it is an anticipated future, hence a future treated as though it were already past...*" (131)
> 
> Definitive: "*It is a word which embodies a claim to arrest time. Whatever you may say, whatever happens, my conviction is unshakable.*" (131)
> 
> "*I can say that the temporal orientation of belief, is in a way, the inverse of that of conviction. The latter refers to an arrest, to a bar that has been drawn; it implies a kind of inner closure. With belief, just the inverse is true.*" (133)

### Belief
> "*To give, or better yet, open a credit account to someone... This, to my mind, is the most essential and constitutive aspect of belief...*" (134)
- Association or identification of belief with trust

### Belief as Credit
> "*I am in no way separable from <u>that which</u> I place at the disposal of this X... Actually, the credit I extend is, in a way, myself. I lend myself to X. We should note at once that this is an essentially mysterious act.*" (134)
- When I am trusting someone, what I '*loan*' them is nothing other than myself.
- To trust some one is to assume that this person is '*after our welfare*' (has our best interests at heart)
	1. {"- "} Their actions directly affect my welfare

### To believe is to believe in...
> "*Whatever is on the hither side of the person always participates in <u>thingness</u>. But how can I put my trust in a thing—which is inert by definition, i.e., incapable of responding?*" (135)
> 
> "*To believe in someone, is to put one's trust in him, i.e.: 'I am sure you will not let me down, that you will instead fulfill my expectations, that you will realize them.' I expressly use the second person here. One can only trust a 'thou,' a reality capable of fulfilling the function of a 'thou,' of being invoked, of becoming something I can fall back on.*" (135)

### Not Simply a Conviction
> "*…this assurance is not a conviction in the sense I have described above; it goes beyond what is given, what I can experience, for it is an extrapolation, a leap, a bet, which like all bets can be lost. The stakes involved are difficult to define—for the reason that it is I who am the credit which I extend to the other.*" (135)

### Unconditional belief/trust?
> "*I have identified myself with the X and I became partly alienated from myself because of him.. My disappointment is in a way a partial destruction of myself. How was it possible to be disappointed, however? Because my reliance on X had a conditional character...*" (136)
> 
> "*…the vulnerability of my belief is linked to the residue of opinion still left in it...*" (136)
- Perhaps that opinion made it such that my trust was really contingent on certain conditions being met.

### Two Boundary-Cases
> 1. "*However strange it may seem to our minds, it is possible for there to be an unconditional love of creature—a gift which will not be revoked. Whatever may occur, whatever disappointment experience inflicts upon out hypothesis, our cherished hopes, this love will remain constant, this credit intact.*"
>
> 2. "*The other boundary case is this: love is faith itself, an invincible assurance based on Being itself. It is here and here alone that we reach **<u>not only an unconditional fact, but a rational unconditional as well</u>**; namely that of the absolute Thou, that which is expressed in the <u>Fiat voluntas tua</u> of the lords prayer*" (136)
