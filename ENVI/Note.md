The philosophy of conservation encompasses various approaches that offer significant benefits for both human societies and the natural world, in contrast to historical views of human dominion and unchecked exploitation [1-9].

Key advantages and benefits of conservation include:

* **Sustainable Resource Management and Future Prosperity**: Conservation, particularly **utilitarian conservation**, focuses on the scientific and systematic management of natural resources [10-12]. This approach aims to ensure their sustained availability and productivity for human use and future generations [10, 13-15]. For instance, the development of forestry schools and laws on forest management were driven by a concern for environmental sustainability, ensuring a reliable supply of timber [14, 16-19]. Forestry evolved from simply cutting trees to a process designed for **maximum long-term efficiency**, considering trees as part of an ecosystem rather than just crops [20-22].

* **Ecological Protection and Environmental Health**: Conservation efforts help **prevent environmental degradation** such as erosion and flooding, and contribute to **fostering healthy drinking water** [22-24]. Protecting specific areas, like those under the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) in the Philippines, helps **conserve biologically important public lands** that are habitats for rare and endangered species of plants and animals, and maintain biogeographic zones and related ecosystems, thus **protecting biodiversity** and **natural heritage** [25].

* **Spiritual, Aesthetic, and Intrinsic Value**:

	* **Nature Preservation** advocates for maintaining wilderness in its wild condition, valuing nature for its **intrinsic, transcendental, and spiritual attributes** [26]. Figures like John Muir believed that spending time in nature could "wash your spirit clean" and that wilderness embodied God [26, 27]. William Wordsworth similarly found nature to be "divinity itself" [16, 28].

	* **Romanticizing nature** fostered a sense of connecting with primal forces, stimulating people's souls and imaginations, and promoting reflective individualism, offering a counterbalance to the perceived artificiality of civilization [29-32].

	* The appreciation of nature for its beauty, spirituality, and recreational value became popular, leading to a burgeoning **rural tourist industry** and the establishment of **urban parks** [10, 33-37]. While this "nature-loving" sometimes paradoxically led to exploitation [33, 38, 39], it brought more people into contact with nature for inspiration and refreshment [40].

* **Animal Welfare and Empathy**: The rise of concern for animal welfare led to the establishment of organizations like **The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA)** in London in the 1820s [33, 41-43]. These societies worked to combat animal abuse, penalize violators, and educate the public on animal welfare [44, 45]. The depiction of animals with human-like characteristics in literature and art (anthropomorphism) fostered **empathy and a more positive view of animals**, contributing to their protection [33, 46-52]. Laws were also passed to protect wild animals, such as those targeting the feather trade, on moral and ecological grounds [53-58].

* **Cultural and Social Recognition**: Modern conservation frameworks, such as the NIPAS, recognize the importance of **protecting indigenous cultural communities** and harmonizing conservation plans with their ancestral domain plans [59]. This acknowledges and promotes the governance, maintenance, development, protection, and conservation of areas by indigenous peoples according to their **indigenous knowledge systems and practices (IKSP) and customary law** [60]. The movement also provided an escape from urban life, leading to the valuing of rural areas and old buildings as sources of "continuity and organic accumulation and of enduring values" that counterbalanced urban "disorder and false values" [61-63].

The philosophy of conservation has led to numerous achievements, reflecting a shift from historical views of human dominion over nature towards more sustainable and appreciative approaches [1-8]. These achievements span various domains:

* **Sustainable Resource Management and Forestry**

	* The emergence of **utilitarian conservation** in the Age of Reason and Enlightenment led to scientific and systematic management of natural resources [2-4, 9-13].

	* **Forestry schools and laws on forest management** were established out of a concern for environmental sustainability and to ensure a reliable supply of timber [14-19]. Forestry evolved from simply cutting trees to a process designed for **maximum long-term efficiency**, recognizing trees as part of an ecosystem [20-23].

	* Prominent figures like **Gifford Pinchot** were instrumental; he was appointed head of the Division of Forestry in the U.S. in 1898 and advocated for **scientific management, sustainable yield, full utilization, fire prevention, and reforestation** [24-26].

	* Conservation efforts helped **prevent environmental degradation** such as erosion and flooding, and contributed to **fostering healthy drinking water** [22, 23, 27, 28].

  

* **Nature Preservation and Protected Areas**

	* The philosophy of **nature preservation**, championed by individuals like **John Muir**, focused on maintaining wilderness in its wild condition and valuing nature for its intrinsic, transcendental, and spiritual attributes [29, 30]. Muir became the first president of the Sierra Club [29, 31].

	* The **United States led the world in creating national parks**, with Yosemite Valley established as a park in 1864 and Yellowstone National Park following eight years later [32-34]. Notably, Congress resisted mining interests from developing Yellowstone [35].

	* Other nations followed, with **France establishing its first national park in 1914** and **Spain creating its first in 1917** [36-38]. **Australia's Royal National Park** was established in 1879 [38].

	* In Great Britain, the **National Trust** was founded in 1895 by philanthropists, dedicated to preserving natural and historical landscapes. By 1938, it protected over 45,000 acres and owned more than 130 historic buildings, demonstrating significant influence [39-41].

	* **Urban parks** were established, providing recreational green spaces that did not threaten the existing societal structure [24].

  

* **Animal Welfare and Empathy**

	* The **Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA)** was established in London in the 1820s, with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), founded in 1824, playing a crucial role in combating animal abuse, penalizing violators, and educating the public on animal welfare [42-47].

	* Laws were passed to protect wild animals, such as the **Sea Birds Preservation Act of 1869**, which was the first national legislation focused on a particular species, and later efforts to end the feather trade [48-53].

	* The increasing depiction of animals with human-like characteristics (anthropomorphism) in literature and art fostered **empathy and a more positive view of animals**, contributing to their protection [42, 54-58].

  

* **Cultural and Social Shifts**

	* Modern conservation frameworks, such as the **National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS)** in the Philippines (RA 7586, s1992 and ENIPAS RA 11038, s2018), explicitly include the **protection of indigenous cultural communities** and the harmonization of conservation plans with their ancestral domain plans [59, 60]. This system recognizes and promotes the governance, maintenance, development, protection, and conservation of areas by indigenous peoples according to their **indigenous knowledge systems and practices (IKSP) and customary law** [60, 61].

	* A growing **appreciation for nature** for aesthetic, spiritual, and recreational purposes became popular, leading to a burgeoning rural tourist industry and the establishment of urban parks [14, 42, 62, 63].

	* The rise of outdoor movements like **Boy Scouts** (founded in England in 1907) and "bushwhackers" in Australia demonstrated a societal shift towards valuing outdoor activities and ruggedness [29, 64, 65].

	* The valuing of rural areas and old buildings as sources of "continuity and organic accumulation and of enduring values" provided a counterbalance to the "disorder and false values" perceived in urban life [66, 67].

The preservation movement, despite its aims to protect nature, has faced several criticisms, often highlighting its limitations, inherent contradictions, or negative impacts on certain groups or economic activities.

Here are some key criticisms:

* **Failure to Curtail Degradation**

	* Nature-loving and preservation efforts, while valuing beauty, spirituality, and recreation, were often **insufficient to halt the relentless degradation of natural resources** driven by industrialization and economic progress [1-3]. These movements sometimes focused more on aesthetic or spiritual appreciation rather than directly confronting the underlying economic forces causing environmental harm [1, 2].

	* The period of intense industrialization saw an unprecedented consumption of natural resources, and arguments for nature preservation often prioritized human spiritual well-being over material welfare, often embodying rather than contradicting material progress [2, 4].

  

* **Conflict with Economic Interests and Livelihoods**

	* Conservationists' calls for "wise, calculated use" of resources often **clashed with deeply held ideals of economic individualism and opportunity** [5, 6].

	* Measures for pollution control or forest management faced **resistance from workers and industrialists** who associated industrial smoke with prosperity and feared that such regulations would jeopardize their jobs and economic comfort [7-9]. The prevailing sentiment was "When there's smook, there is brass" (money) [7, 9].

	* Forest laws and preservation efforts **negatively impacted poor and rural communities** who relied on natural resources for their livelihoods, such as collecting wood for fuel or foraging [10, 11]. For example, plans to convert pastures into forests were met with lament from residents who depended on those lands for "flocks, no fertilizer, no harvests" [11].

	* The rise of recreational hunting and the establishment of private hunting/fishing parks by wealthy individuals were criticized for **monopolizing natural resources for leisure**, often at the expense of local communities' traditional hunting rights, leading to conflicts and retaliation [12-15].

  

* **Elitism and Exclusion**

	* Some outdoor and nature-loving movements, such as "bushwhacker" clubs and the Boy Scouts, were perceived as **"self-serving" and "patently elitist"**, appealing mainly to educated men seeking specific experiences like "hardihood, resolution, and danger," rather than benefiting a broader public [16-18].

	* Park management practices often involved the **"excising" of indigenous peoples** from protected areas, as their long-standing presence was seen to "violate Caucasian expectations of wilderness" [19].

  

* **Paradox of Nature Tourism**

	* While promoting appreciation for nature, tourism paradoxically contributed to the **commercialization and "urbanization" of natural and rural areas**, introducing elements like "ugly billboards, petrol stations" and overall human impact that undermined the very tranquility and wildness they sought to appreciate [20-24].

  

* **Selective Preservation and Compromise with Exploitation**

	* Park managers sometimes engaged in **selective preservation**, protecting certain landscapes or species while actively eliminating others, such as shooting "wolves, coyotes, mountain lions, hawks, and other predators" [25].

	* Despite being protected, parks sometimes **tolerated logging and mining interests**, with their establishment occasionally driven by economic motives like attracting tourists via railroads rather than solely for ecological preservation [26, 27].

  

* **Conceptual Limitations (Anthropomorphism)**

	* The practice of **anthropomorphism** (imputing human characteristics to non-humans), which became prevalent in depicting animals in literature and popular culture, contributed to a more positive view of animals and fostered animal protection movements [28, 29]. However, ecologists and environmentalists have criticized it as a sign of **"humanity's inability to understand and respect other creatures on their own terms"** [29, 30].

  

* **Internal Disagreements within the Movement**

	* There were internal critiques, particularly from more radical preservationists (like those influenced by John Muir), who criticized "conservation" approaches for allowing any resource use, such as grazing livestock on federal lands or building reservoirs in natural valleys like Hetch Hetchy [3, 31, 32]. They saw such compromises as contradicting the true preservation of wilderness [32].

* **Contradictions in National Identity and Progress**
	* An inherent irony existed in nations, such as the young United States, celebrating their "unparalleled forests and mountains" as symbols of national identity and divine favor, while simultaneously **"ploughing up, cutting down, and otherwise subduing the very wilderness"** for economic development and industry [33, 34].

	* Even regimes like the Nazis, who "venerated both natural landscapes and industrial growth," showcased a paradoxical approach where nature appreciation coexisted with aggressive industrialization [35, 36].
