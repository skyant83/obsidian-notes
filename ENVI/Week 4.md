## Day 1
The Sierra Club, founded in **1892 by John Muir**, has historically been a significant advocate for environmental preservation in the United States.

**Main Advocacies and Evolution:**

- **Early Advocacies (Late 19th - Mid-20th Century)**:
	- Initially, the Sierra Club served as the primary advocate for the **preservation of large parks in the US**.
	- It spearheaded efforts to set aside **millions of acres of land specifically for wilderness**, a pioneering initiative that ultimately led to the Wilderness Act of 1964.
	- The organization successfully opposed the construction of dams in significant natural areas, including the Dinosaur National Monument and the Grand Canyon. These actions demonstrated its commitment to **wilderness preservation over economic development**. One of its former leaders, David Brower, proclaimed his allegiance to "wilderness for itself alone".
- **Growth and Mainstream Influence (1960s onwards)**:
	- The Sierra Club experienced substantial growth in membership, increasing from 20,000 in 1959 to 113,000 by 1970.
	- By the 1970s, and continuing into the 21st century, it established itself as **one of the most influential and well-funded environmental organizations in North America**, leveraging its Legal Defense Fund and lobbying activities.
	- As a mainstream environmental group, the Sierra Club adopted an **anthropocentric approach**, prioritizing the use of nature for the benefit of present and future human generations. This contrasts with more radical groups that emerged later, which hold biocentric beliefs, valuing nature intrinsically, irrespective of its human utility.
- **Changes and Perceived Moderation**:
	- By the 1970s, the Sierra Club was perceived by some as having been **eclipsed by more radical environmental groups**.
	- A segment of activists became disillusioned with mainstream organizations like the Sierra Club, viewing them as **ineffective, overly compromising, and bureaucratic**.
	- This dissatisfaction led prominent figures, such as David Brower, to leave the Sierra Club in 1970 and co-found more radical groups like Friends of the Earth. Similarly, Dave Foreman, a co-founder of Earth First!, explicitly stated his desire to create a radical wing that would make the Sierra Club "look moderate".
	- This shift indicates that while the Sierra Club remained a powerful force, its approach became seen as more moderate compared to the increasingly radical environmental movements advocating for more profound systemic changes beyond mere conservation or pollution control.

When the Sierra Club first started, its main advocacies were primarily focused on the preservation of natural landscapes and wilderness areas in the United States.

The main advocacies of the Sierra Club when it first started include:

- **Preservation of Large Parks:** For several decades after its founding in 1892 by John Muir, the Sierra Club was the **principal advocate for the preservation of large parks in the US**.
- **Setting Aside Wilderness:** It initiated and led efforts to **set aside millions of acres of land specifically for wilderness**. This was considered an unprecedented effort that ultimately led to the **Wilderness Act of 1964**.
- **Opposition to Damming Natural Areas:** The organization successfully campaigned against the construction of dams in significant natural sites, specifically **opposing the damming of the Grand Canyon and a dam in Dinosaur National Monument**. This demonstrated a commitment to **wilderness preservation over economic development**. David Brower, a former leader, expressed allegiance to "wilderness for itself alone".
