## Day 2
### Ecosystem
- Fundamental ecological unit for the study of the environment.
- **Structure**
	- <u>biotic</u> and <u>abiotic</u> components and their relationships
- Processes
	- the flow of energy and nutrients within an... 
- System Concepts
	1. State Variables --> stores resources such energy, matter, water, etc.
	2. Flow --> the pathways by which those resources move from one state variable to another
		- Affected by human involvement
	3. Open System --> receive from their surroundings and produce outputs and leave the systems
	4. Closed System --> no matter and energy exchange with its surroundings; a **pseudo-closed** system are those that exchange some energy, but no matter with their surroundings
	5. Positive or reinforcing feedbacks --> a self perpetuating process that amplifies itself
	6. Negative or balancing feedback that suppress- change and balances itself
	7. Disturbances in Systemic Stability --> events that can destabilize or change the system but might be also normal for the system
	8. Resilience --> ability to recover from disturbance, but severe disturbance
