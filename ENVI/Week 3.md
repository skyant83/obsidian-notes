## Day 1
### Urbanization and Industrialization
> Mid ${} 19^{th}$ to $20^{th}$ century
#### Industrial Revolution
- Drastic increase of fossil fuel consumption and $CO_2$ emissions in 1850s
- Economic activity concentrated in high population density locations --> capitalism cutting costs of production in rural areas

#### Conservation
- "Planned management"
- Gifford Pinchot as one of the earliest conservationists
- Appointed as head of the Division of Forestry in US (1898)
- Advocated scientific management, sustainable yield, full utilization, fire prevention, reforestation.

#### Reintegration of Nature in Urban
- Urban Parks did not threaten the status quo.
- Return to the country-side: widely-spread suburban homes with gardens, separated by ample wood
- Industrialization brought people to the city <-> provided means and motive to travel between urban and rural
- A "civilized way" of loving nature
