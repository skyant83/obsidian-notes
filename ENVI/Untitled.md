Suppose that the amount of money spent at shopping centers between 4 pm and 6pm on sundays has a normal distribution with mean 4250 and a standard distribution of 1000.

a) prob shopper spent > php 4750 at the mall

$$
\begin{align}
	Z &= \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} \\
	  &= \frac{4750-4250}{1000} \\
	  &= 0.5 \textrm{ or } 50\%
\end{align}
$$


b) prob shopper spent 4750-5750

$$
Z = 0.5 \textrm{ or } 50\%


\\
\begin{align}
	
\end{align}
$$

c) prob that two random select shoppers prob both spent more 5750
